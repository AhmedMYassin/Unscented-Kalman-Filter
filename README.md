# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

Unscented Kalman Filter is used to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. The output RMSE for `p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y` is <= `.09, .10, .40, .30`

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.
```
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF
```
